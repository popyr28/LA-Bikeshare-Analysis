# LA-Bikeshare-Analysis
The bike-share Trip Analysis is a project of the mini course Data Analytics by RevoU. The case study requires analytical new three insight from the dataset. The original dataset extract from BigQuery which is Austin Bike-share Trip. Here, I used Los Angeles Bike-share Trip data that retrieve from Kaggle. I can't provide all of datasets because it is too large to be on github, if you need, you can found them in Kaggle. I utilized Python and Tableau in this case. Tableau used to make dashboard visualization of the insights.

1) Goals that will be reached: Daily user or Walk-up user will be Membership
2) Analytical Question: How Walk-up user and member use bike share differently?
        sub question: a) Busy hours? Busy Day in a week? Busy Month?
                      b) Growth number of bikeshare user from year to year?
                      c) Top station to start trip and end trip?
                      d) Correlation between passholder_type and trip_route_category & bike_type
                      e) Correlation between day in a week with passholder_type and trip_route_category
3) Recommendation will be in the last.
